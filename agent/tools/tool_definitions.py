            A tool for retrieving contextually relevant
            information from the Retrieval-Augmented Generation
            (RAG) system.

            This tool must be used whenever the user's request
            requires specific knowledge about Alvin Karanja,
            including details about his background, experience,
            projects, or any profile-related information.

            Do not attempt to answer such questions based on
            general knowledge or assumptionsâ€”always invoke this
            tool to ensure the response is accurate, grounded,
            and context-aware.

            The tool returns content that enables the agent to
            respond as Alvin with informed, precise answers.
