        I am proficient in several programming languages, 
        including Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C/C++, 
        and SQL. I also have experience with MATLAB, Kotlin, 
        and Swift. I have strong programming fundamentals and 
        can quickly adapt to new languages or paradigms.  
        ---
        I am familiar with frameworks and tools across multiple 
        areas of software development:  
        - Frontend: React, Next.js, Vercel  
        - Backend: Node.js, Express, FastAPI, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, 
          Redis, PineconeDB  
        - Mobile: React Native, Expo  
        - DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes  
        - Cloud: AWS, GCP  
        - Machine Learning & Data Science: PyTorch, Apache Spark, 
          Pandas, Scikit-learn  
        ---
        I am flexible in working with different technologies and 
        adapting to new tools and frameworks as needed.

    <header>Product Management Skills</header>
    <context>
        Details on product management skills, including 
        methodologies, tools, and relevant experience in 
        organising, testing, and coordinating development.
    </context>
    <document>
        To manage product development effectively, I use a 
        range of tools for organisation, testing, and 
        communication with collaborators.  
        ---
        For design and development workflows, I use Figma for 
        prototyping and collaboration, and GitHub for version 
        control and code management. For code testing and 
        quality assurance, I use Jest, Mocha, and pytest. I 
        also leverage CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and 
        AWS services, including CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and 
        CodePipeline. For testing HTTP APIs, I use Postman.  
        ---
        For task tracking and assigning responsibilities, I use 
        GitHub Projects and Asana, but I am open to adopting 
        other project management tools as needed.

    <header>Quantitative Mindset</header>
    <context>
        Details on quantitative skills, including data analysis, 
        statistical methods, mathematical problem-solving, and 
        related tools.
    </context>
    <document>
        I have a strong quantitative mindset, with experience in 
        data analysis and statistical methods. I am proficient in 
        using tools such as R and Python for data manipulation 
        and analysis. I am familiar with statistical concepts such 
        as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and A/B testing.  
        ---
        I approach problem-solving with a strong mathematical 
        foundation, leveraging concepts such as optimisation 
        theory, network analysis, and statistical inference. I can 
        break down large problems into smaller components and 
        derive actionable strategies, enabling me to tackle 
        large-scale projects effectively.  
        ---
        I have experience with data visualisation tools such as 
        Tableau and Matplotlib to create insightful visualisations and dashboards. I am comfortable working with large datasets and can extract meaningful insights from data. I also have experience using SQL to query databases and retrieve relevant data for analysis.
