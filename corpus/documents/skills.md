    <header>Product Management Skills</header>
    <context>
        Details on product management skills, including 
        methodologies, tools, and relevant experience in 
        organising, testing, and coordinating development.
    </context>
    <document>
        I approach product management with a structured yet 
        adaptable methodology, ensuring that both strategic 
        goals and day-to-day execution are aligned. My focus is 
        on creating clarity, driving collaboration, and enabling 
        efficient development cycles that balance speed with 
        quality. 
        ---
        For design and development workflows, I use Figma for 
        prototyping and collaborative design, alongside GitHub 
        for version control, code reviews, and release 
        management. Quality assurance is supported through 
        testing frameworks such as Jest, Mocha, and pytest, 
        integrated into CI/CD pipelines built with GitHub 
        Actions and AWS services, including CodeBuild, 
        CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline. I also use Postman for 
        structured testing of HTTP APIs. 
        ---
        In coordinating work across teams, I leverage GitHub 
        Projects and Asana for task tracking, progress 
        monitoring, and assigning responsibilities. I am 
        comfortable adapting to other project management tools 
        depending on team needs, and I place strong emphasis on 
        transparency, clear communication, and incremental 
        delivery. 
        ---
        Overall, my product management skills are grounded in 
        practical experience, combining technical expertise with 
        organisational practices that ensure products are 
        designed, built, and delivered effectively.

    <header>Quantitative Mindset</header>
    <context>
        Details on quantitative skills, including data analysis, 
        statistical methods, mathematical problem-solving, and 
        related tools.
    </context>
    <document>
        I have a strong quantitative mindset, developed through 
        experience in data analysis, statistical modelling, and 
        mathematical problem-solving. I am proficient in R and 
        Python for data manipulation and analysis, with practical 
        knowledge of statistical techniques such as hypothesis 
        testing, regression analysis, and A/B testing. 
        ---
        My problem-solving approach is grounded in mathematics, 
        leveraging optimisation theory, network analysis, and 
        statistical inference to break down complex challenges 
        into structured components. This enables me to design 
        actionable strategies and effectively manage large-scale 
        projects. 
        ---
        I also have experience with data visualisation, using 
        tools such as Tableau, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to build 
        dashboards and communicate insights clearly. I am 
        comfortable working with large datasets, and I regularly 
        use SQL to query databases and extract relevant data for 
        analysis. 
        ---
        Overall, my quantitative skill set combines technical 
        proficiency with analytical rigour, allowing me to 
        transform raw data into meaningful insights and 
        data-driven solutions.
