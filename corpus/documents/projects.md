    <document>
        I developed Portfolio Agent, an AI-powered assistant 
        designed to help visitors engage with my portfolio 
        website by providing interactive, context-aware 
        responses about my background, skills, and projects. 
        The agent leverages a custom retrieval-augmented 
        generation (RAG) pipeline to deliver personalised 
        content and streamline user interactions. 
        ---
        I implemented a variation of Anthropic’s contextual 
        retrieval framework, adapting it to improve the agent’s 
        ability to surface relevant information and respond with 
        greater nuance. Future development plans include 
        integrating knowledge graph capabilities to enhance 
        contextual reasoning and multi-hop retrieval. 
        ---
        A key feature of the agent is its ability to construct 
        tailored application materials. By combining structured 
        retrieval with generative outputs, it can create 
        role-specific resumes and cover letters for users, 
        making it a practical demonstration of applied AI for 
        personal branding and career support. 
        ---
        From a technical perspective, the agent is production-
        ready. It is developed in Python with robust unit tests 
        written in pytest, ensuring reliability and stability. 
        The system is fully containerised and deployed on a 
        Kubernetes cluster hosted on a custom EC2 configuration 
        in AWS. A CI/CD pipeline manages updates and 
        maintenance, enabling seamless iteration and 
        improvements. 
        ---
        This project demonstrates my ability to combine AI 
        research concepts with full-stack engineering and 
        cloud-native deployment, creating a practical, 
        user-facing system that bridges innovation and 
        functionality.

    <document>
        I served as Co-Chief Electrical Systems Engineer for 
        Warwick Racing, where I led the design and development 
        of the team’s third-generation electric race car. The 
        project successfully passed scrutineering and competed 
        at FSUK 2024, achieving 9th place in the EV class at 
        Silverstone. 
        ---
        In this role, I co-led a team of seven engineering 
        students, overseeing the design and implementation of 
        critical electrical systems. These included a high-
        voltage junction box, a power distribution network, and 
        a DC-DC conversion system to reliably power low-voltage 
        electronics from the high-voltage tractive system. My 
        responsibilities extended to PCB design, circuit 
        modelling, prototyping, and hands-on tasks such as 
        soldering and hardware assembly. 
        ---
        Beyond the technical aspects, I managed relationships 
        with stakeholders and collaborated with cross-functional 
        teams to ensure seamless integration of electrical 
        components within the broader vehicle architecture. I 
        also played a role in promoting the project, helping 
        Warwick Racing gain visibility — including a feature on 
        BBC Midlands. 
        ---
        This experience strengthened my expertise in electrical 
        systems engineering while also developing my leadership, 
        project management, and communication skills within a 
        high-performance, competitive engineering environment.

<section>
    <id>projects_gatsby</id>
    <header>Project: Gatsby</header>
    <context>
        Details of my project Gatsby, addressing skills such as 
        React Native, Solidity, TypeScript, Firebase, Express.js, 
        Truffle Suite, Web3.js, and Expo.
    </context>
    <document>
        I founded Gatsby, a Web3-based ticket distribution 
        platform that leverages blockchain and decentralised 
        storage to improve fairness and security in event 
        ticketing. The system encapsulates tickets as non-
        fungible digital assets, enabling transparent 
        authentication and ownership tracking. 
        ---
        I designed a custom RESTful architecture that integrated 
        the Ethereum blockchain, IPFS for distributed file 
        storage, and a back-end system built with Express.js and 
        Firebase. To combat ticket fraud, I developed a novel 
        authentication algorithm that strengthened validation 
        mechanisms and ensured trust in peer-to-peer transfers. 
        ---
        On the front end, I built a production-grade UI/UX using 
        React Native and Expo for both iOS and Android. The 
        application achieved an 80% user approval rating for 
        visual design and usability, reflecting the success of 
        user-centred design decisions. 
        ---
        Beyond technical development, I conducted extensive 
        research into blockchain applications for ticketing. I 
        formalised these findings in my undergraduate 
        dissertation, which achieved a first-class 
        classification. This work deepened my expertise in 
        Solidity, smart contract design, and decentralised 
        architectures, while also showcasing my ability to 
        translate research into a practical, impactful product.

    <header>Machine Learning Research</header>
    <context>
        Details of my project Machine Learning Research, 
        addressing skills such as MATLAB, data science, linear 
        algebra, and multivariable calculus.
    </context>
    <document>
        I conducted research in machine learning focused on 
        developing non-linear prediction models and evaluating 
        cost functions under different optimisation frameworks. 
        I implemented and compared algorithms such as Linear 
        Regression, Logistic Regression, and Newtonian Descent, 
        building a strong foundation in supervised learning 
        methods. 
        ---
        My work required mastery of core machine learning 
        concepts, including gradient-based optimisation, 
        regularisation techniques, and convergence analysis. 
        I applied principles of linear algebra and multivariable 
        calculus to derive update rules, evaluate model 
        stability, and improve training efficiency. 
        ---
        I engineered MATLAB scripts to conduct regression 
        analysis, construct statistical models, and minimise 
        cost function errors with high precision—achieving error 
        thresholds as low as 10^(-5). This process involved 
        iterative testing, debugging, and validation to ensure 
        robust model performance. 
        ---
        This research not only strengthened my practical coding 
        ability in MATLAB but also deepened my conceptual 
        understanding of the mathematical foundations of machine 
        learning, preparing me to apply these principles across 
        more advanced models and frameworks.

        Details of my project Getaway, addressing skills such as 
        Three.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Blender, and Vite.
    </context>
    <document>
        I developed Getaway, an interactive 3D web-based game 
        built with Three.js and WebGL, inspired by classic arcade 
        driving titles. The game challenges players to navigate 
        obstacles and avoid NPC-controlled vehicles while 
        progressing through increasingly difficult levels. 
        ---
        A key feature of the project was my use of mathematical 
        methods to enhance gameplay. I implemented deterministic 
        spawning algorithms that leveraged trigonometric 
        functions to calculate NPC positions, paths, and timing. 
        This created a balanced yet challenging difficulty curve, 
        ensuring the game remained engaging without relying on 
        randomness. 
        ---
        I further optimised state management in JavaScript by 
        designing a custom garbage collection routine for 
        dynamically loaded assets, improving performance in 
        densely populated levels. In addition, I designed and 
        modelled custom voxel-style assets in Blender, 
        contributing to the game’s 1980s-inspired aesthetic. 
        ---
        Getaway reflects both my creativity in game design and 
        my ability to apply mathematical reasoning to gameplay 
        mechanics, demonstrating a blend of technical precision 
        and user-focused design.
