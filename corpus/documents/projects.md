    <header>Portfolio Agent</header>
    <context>
        AI-powered portfolio assistant using a custom RAG 
        pipeline, contextual retrieval, and web development, 
        built with Python, Kubernetes, and AWS.

    <document>
        I developed Portfolio Agent, an AI-powered tool to 
        assist visitors to my portfolio website in engaging 
        with my profile and work. The agent uses a custom RAG 
        pipeline to enable context-aware interactions and 
        personalised content delivery.  
        ---
        I utilised a variation of Anthropic’s contextual 
        retrieval framework to enhance the agent's ability to 
        provide relevant information and suggestions based on 
        user interactions. I plan to implement knowledge graph 
        capabilities to further improve the agent's contextual 
        understanding and information retrieval.  
        ---
        Using a structured approach, the agent can construct a 
        custom resume and cover letter for users based on a 
        defined role to enhance engagement.  
        ---
        The agent is production-ready, developed in Python, 
        with pytest used to ensure robust testing and 
        reliability. It is containerised and deployed using 
        Kubernetes on a custom EC2 configuration in AWS, with 
        plans to implement a CI/CD pipeline for streamlined 
        updates and maintenance.

    <header>Formula Student</header>
    <context>
        Details of my project Formula Student, addressing skills 
        such as electrical systems engineering, PCB design, 
        Fusion 360, circuit design, soldering, and prototyping.
    </context>
    <document>
        I served as Co-Chief Electrical Systems Engineer for 
        Warwick Racing, leading the development of a third-
        generation electric race car. The project successfully 
        passed scrutineering and competed at FSUK 2024, securing 
        9th place in the EV class at Silverstone.  
        ---
        I co-led a team of seven engineering students in 
        designing and developing key electrical systems, 
        including a high-voltage junction box, a power 
        distribution network, and a DC-DC conversion system to 
        efficiently power low-voltage electronics from the 
        high-voltage tractive system.  
        ---
        I managed relationships with stakeholders and cross-
        functional teams to ensure smooth integration of 
        electrical components, coordinated development efforts, 
        and promoted the team — including a feature on BBC 
        Midlands.

<!-- Gatsby -->
<section>
    <id>projects_gatsby</id>
    <header>Gatsby</header>
    <context>
        Details of my project Gatsby, addressing skills such as 
        React Native, Solidity, TypeScript, Firebase, Express.js, 
        Truffle Suite, Web3.js, and Expo.
    </context>
    <document>
        I founded Gatsby, a Web3-based ticket distribution 
        platform, designing a custom RESTful architecture to 
        integrate the Ethereum blockchain, IPFS network, and a 
        back-end system. I developed a unique ticket 
        authentication algorithm to enhance security and prevent 
        fraud.  
        ---
        I designed and developed a production-grade UI/UX for an 
        iOS and Android-compatible app, achieving an 80% user 
        approval rating for visual appeal and usability.  
        ---
        I conducted extensive research into blockchain 
        technology, formalising my findings in my undergraduate 
        dissertation, which achieved a first-class classification.

<!-- Machine Learning Research -->
<section>
    <id>projects_machine_learning_research</id>
    <header>Machine Learning Research</header>
    <context>
        Details of my project Machine Learning Research, 
        addressing skills such as MATLAB, data science, linear 
        algebra, and multivariable calculus.
    </context>
    <document>
        I developed non-linear prediction models by evaluating 
        various cost functions and applying advanced optimisation 
        algorithms, including Linear Regression, Logistic 
        Regression, and Newtonian Descent.  
        ---
        I engineered MATLAB scripts to perform regression 
        analysis and construct statistical models, minimising 
        cost function errors in predictions to a precision of 
        below 10^(-5).

        Details of my project Getaway, addressing skills such as 
        Three.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Blender, and Vite.
    </context>
    <document>
        I developed Getaway, an interactive 3D web-based game 
        using Three.js and WebGL, implementing a deterministic 
        NPC algorithm leveraging trigonometric properties for an 
        enhanced gameplay challenge.  
        ---
        I optimised state management in JavaScript for densely 
        populated game levels by developing a custom garbage 
        collector for in-game assets. I also designed and created 
        custom models in Blender.
