        I approach problem-solving using a top-down methodology, 
        allowing me to quickly understand the bigger picture and 
        structure effective solutions.  
        ---
        I work effectively in fast-paced environments, adapting

        productive. I can learn rapidly, work independently, and 
        collaborate effectively, making me a strong contributor 
        in any setting.

        disciplined and self-motivated, maintaining consistent

<!-- Weaknesses -->
<section>
    <id>personal_weaknesses</id>
    <header>Weaknesses</header>
    <context>
        Key weaknesses including delegation, workload 
        management, and professional experience.
    </context>
    <document>
        My weaknesses often stem from my curiosity and drive to 
        learn, which can lead me to take on too much at once. I 
        have actively worked to improve these areas through 
        better delegation, prioritisation, and self-awareness.  
        ---
        I used to struggle with delegation, often taking on too 
        much myself in team settings. I have improved by 
        understanding team strengths and structuring work 
        distribution more effectively.  
        ---
        I sometimes spread myself thin due to my passion for 
        multiple projects, which can result in context switching 
        and reduced efficiency. I now prioritise long-term goals 
        and postpone new projects until I can dedicate full 
        attention to them.  
        ---
        I have limited professional experience, but I am 
        proactive in learning institutional best practices and 
        actively seek opportunities to gain more industry 
        exposure.
