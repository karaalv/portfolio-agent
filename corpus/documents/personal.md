        My hobbies reflect both my intellectual curiosity and 
        my interest in maintaining a balanced lifestyle. I enjoy 
        reading widely, particularly on topics such as history, 
        economics, and technology, which help me build a more

        and science, applying these concepts in my projects. 
        ---
        Recently, I have been particularly focused on 
        quantitative research and algorithmic trading. I am 
        exploring trading strategies, data-driven modelling, and 
        financial theory, with plans to develop a fully fledged 
        algorithmic trading system as a long-term personal 
        project. 
        ---
        These hobbies combine learning, creativity, and 
        discipline, reflecting my drive to grow intellectually 
        while also maintaining balance through fitness and 
        hands-on experimentation.

        the challenge of applying them to solve real-world 
        problems. 
        ---
        Beyond technology, I am passionate about building a 
        deeper understanding of the world through history, 
        economics, and global affairs. I believe that learning 
        about the past and the forces shaping societies provides 
        valuable perspective on current events and future 
        trends. To nurture this curiosity, I dedicate time each 
        month to researching a new topic in depth. 
        ---
        Some of the areas I have explored include the 2008 
        financial crisis, the industrialisation of China, and 
        the history of central banking. This practice has helped 
        me develop a well-rounded worldview and the ability to 
        engage in thoughtful conversations on a wide range of 
        topics. 
        ---

        resilience, and build new skills. 
        ---
        I also believe in the responsible use of technology. 
        Technology should not exist for its own sake, but should 
        be directed toward solving humanity’s most pressing 
        problems, improving quality of life, and expanding our 
        collective understanding of the universe. In this sense, 
        I see technological progress as both a practical tool and 
        a moral responsibility. 
        ---
        Overall, my opinions reflect a worldview grounded in

        Key strengths including adaptability, resilience, 
        discipline, collaboration, and rapid learning.
    </context>
    <document>
        One of my core strengths is problem-solving. I take a 
        top-down approach, starting with the bigger picture and 
        systematically breaking challenges into smaller, 
        manageable components. This allows me to structure 
        effective solutions that balance practicality with long-
        term scalability. 
        ---
        I thrive in fast-paced environments where adaptability 
        and focus are critical. I am able to quickly adjust to 
        new challenges, absorb unfamiliar concepts, and remain 
        productive under pressure. My ability to learn rapidly 
        enables me to take on complex technical domains and 
        deliver results efficiently. 
        ---
        Discipline and resilience are central to how I work. I 
        maintain consistent focus and motivation over extended 
        periods, managing high workloads without compromising 
        quality. I see setbacks as opportunities to refine my 
        approach, and I adapt strategies until I reach the 
        desired outcome. 
        ---
        Collaboration is another key strength. I work well in 
        diverse teams, bringing strong communication skills and 
        an open mindset to group projects. I adapt workflows to 
        support the team’s goals and actively contribute to an 
        environment of shared accountability and progress. 
        ---
        Together, these strengths — analytical problem-solving, 
        adaptability, resilience, discipline, rapid learning, 
        and collaboration — make me an effective contributor in 
        both independent and team-driven settings.

<!-- Weaknesses -->

    <header>Weaknesses</header>
    <context>
        Key weaknesses including delegation, workload 
        management, and professional experience.
    </context>
    <document>
        My weaknesses are often linked to my curiosity and drive 
        to take on ambitious projects, which can sometimes lead 
        me to overextend myself. I have become increasingly aware 
        of this tendency and have worked to improve through 
        better prioritisation, delegation, and structured 
        workload management. 
        ---
        Delegation was a challenge earlier in my career, as I 
        often preferred to take ownership of tasks myself. Over 
        time, I have improved by recognising the importance of 
        leveraging team strengths, distributing responsibilities 
        more effectively, and building trust through 
        collaboration. 
        ---
        I also have a tendency to pursue multiple interests in 
        parallel, which can result in context switching and 
        reduced efficiency. To counter this, I now focus on 
        aligning projects with long-term goals and pacing new 
        initiatives to ensure I can dedicate the necessary 
        attention to each. 
        ---
        While I have limited professional experience compared to 
        seasoned practitioners, I am highly proactive in seeking 
        opportunities to learn from real-world environments. I 
        actively study industry best practices, draw lessons 
        from experienced mentors, and treat every project as an 
        opportunity to close the gap between academic knowledge 
        and professional application. 
        ---
        Overall, I view weaknesses as areas of growth. By 
        approaching them with reflection and discipline, I have 
        been able to turn challenges into learning opportunities 
        that strengthen both my skills and mindset.

        Information about personal background, such as my nationality,
        and where I grew up.
    </context>
    <document>
        I am a Kenyan national. I spent much of my early childhood in 
        Johannesburg, South Africa, before returning to Nairobi, Kenya, 
        where I completed my secondary education. Following this, I moved 
        to the United Kingdom to pursue higher education—first completing 
        my bachelor’s degree at Warwick University, and later my master’s 
        degree at Imperial College London. These transitions across different 
        countries and cities have shaped both my personal and professional 
        outlook.
        ---
        I consider myself an international individual, shaped by the 
        cultures and experiences of Africa and Europe. Having lived in 
        diverse settings, I have developed a strong sense of adaptability, 
        resilience, and open-mindedness. This global exposure has not only 
        broadened my worldview but also deepened my appreciation for 
        inclusivity and cross-cultural collaboration. I actively seek out 
        opportunities to engage with people from varied backgrounds, as I 
        believe that diverse perspectives drive innovation and meaningful 
        connections.
