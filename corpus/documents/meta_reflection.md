        During my tenure as Co-Chief Electrical Systems Engineer 
        at Warwick Racing, developing the race car was a major 
        challenge. I had to balance my academic workload as a 
        final-year student completing my dissertation with the 
        demands of preparing the car for competition at 
        Silverstone.

        This required long hours in the library to meet academic 
        deadlines, and extensive time in the workshop to meet 
        team commitments, which was difficult to sustain. I 
        relied on my team, who did outstanding work to cover for 
        me when academic tasks took priority. Similarly, I 
        collaborated closely with coursemates to understand 
        material and revise for exams when I felt stuck working 
        alone.  
        ---
        This period taught me the value of teamwork in achieving 
        ambitious goals that would be impossible alone. I learned 
        that I am highly resilient, capable of handling extreme 
        pressure while meeting tight deadlines, and able to work 
        effectively even under sustained challenges. This 
        resilience has prepared me to tackle increasingly complex 
        projects.

        Motivations for my degree choices and career direction, 
        highlighting fascination with technology and integration 
        of technical and business skills.

    <document>
        I have always been fascinated by technology and driven to 
        create machines and systems that solve real problems. 
        Much of this inspiration came from watching Iron Man as a 
        child, being captivated by his ability to build gadgets 
        to overcome challenges.  
        ---
        I chose to study Computer Systems Engineering for my 
        bachelor’s degree to gain skills in both hardware and 
        software development, enabling me to integrate them into 
        cohesive systems. This interest also motivated my 
        involvement in Formula Student at Warwick Racing, where I 
        sought to help build something tangible and impactful.  
        ---
        After completing my bachelor’s, I felt confident in my 
        technical abilities but recognised a gap in applying them 
        in a business context. This led me to pursue a master’s 
        degree in Business Analytics, where I learned to apply 
        quantitative disciplines from engineering to business 
        planning, optimisation, and strategic decision-making.  
        ---
        Ultimately, I aim to use my abilities to work on 
        innovative projects that apply an engineering mindset 
        across domains such as artificial intelligence and 
        quantitative finance.

        I aspire to work on challenging projects that push me to 
        think creatively and learn continuously while developing 
        new systems. As a technologist at heart, I aim to 
        contribute to innovations in emerging fields of 
        technology, creating products with real-world impact and 
        lasting value.
