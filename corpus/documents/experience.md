        Internship experience in generative AI, vector search, 
        and NLP workflow automation, using LangChain, GPT-3, 
        PineconeDB, JavaScript, and AWS S3.

        I worked as a Machine Learning Research and Development 
        Intern at Tracom Services Limited in Nairobi, Kenya, 
        from August 2023 to September 2023. 
        ---
        I led the development of internal AI tools that applied 
        large language models to real business workflows. Using 
        LangChain and GPT-3, I engineered applications capable 
        of summarising lengthy reports and meeting transcripts, 
        reducing manual processing time by over five hours per 
        week and enabling faster decision-making. 
        ---
        To improve knowledge access, I designed and implemented 
        a production-ready vector search system with PineconeDB. 
        This system enabled contextual retrieval of internal 
        documentation, accelerating research workflows by an 
        estimated factor of ten and making knowledge management 
        significantly more efficient. 
        ---
        I also optimised documentation pipelines by deploying 
        NLP-powered summarisation models. Using LangChain, 
        JavaScript, and AWS S3, I built a workflow that could 
        condense 20–50 page technical reports into concise 1–2 
        page summaries tailored for business and sales teams. 
        This automation improved cross-departmental efficiency 
        by delivering actionable insights in near real-time. 
        ---
        This internship gave me hands-on experience in AI 
        engineering, particularly in integrating LLMs with 
        retrieval systems, designing scalable pipelines, and 
        deploying NLP-driven automation to solve practical 
        business challenges.

    <header>Fintech Internship</header>
    <context>
        Internship experience in backend development, data 
        engineering, API design, and mathematical computation, 
        using PostgreSQL, Java, and Postman.
    </context>
    <document>
        I worked as a Back-end Development Intern at Fintech 
        Transformative Technology in Nairobi, Kenya, from July 
        2022 to August 2022. 
        ---
        My work focused on building reliable backend services 
        and strengthening data infrastructure for multi-regional 
        commercial banking applications. I implemented 
        PostgreSQL query pipelines across multiple relational 
        tables, extracting operational insights that improved 
        system reliability and reporting accuracy. 
        ---
        I was actively involved in API design, evaluating trade-
        offs between REST and SOAP paradigms to determine the 
        most efficient system architecture. I contributed to the 
        design and testing of distributed backend services, 
        using Postman for validation and debugging to ensure 
        robust and scalable endpoints. 
        ---
        Beyond system integration, I also developed a custom 
        Complex Number Class in Java, implemented using Euler 
        forms. This supported advanced mathematical operations, 
        laying the groundwork for analytical tools that could be 
        extended into financial modelling and quantitative 
        computations. 
        ---
        This internship strengthened my backend development 
        skills, giving me hands-on experience in database 
        engineering, API design, and mathematical programming 
        for real-world fintech applications.
