    <context>
        Internship experience in generative AI, vector search, 
        and NLP workflow automation, using LangChain, GPT-3, 
        PineconeDB, JavaScript, and AWS S3.

        I worked as a Machine Learning Research and Development 
        Intern at Tracom Services Limited in Nairobi, Kenya, 
        from August 2023 to September 2023.  
        ---
        I led the development of internal AI tooling using 
        LangChain and GPT-3, building applications that 
        leveraged large language models to summarise extensive 
        reports and meeting transcripts, reducing manual effort 
        by five hours per week.  
        ---
        I designed and implemented a vector-based search system 
        using PineconeDB, enabling contextual retrieval of 
        internal documentation and accelerating research 
        workflows by ten times.  
        ---
        I optimised the documentation workflow by deploying NLP 
        summarisation models with LangChain, JavaScript, and AWS 
        S3, condensing 20 to 50 page technical reports into 1 to 2 page 
        actionable insights for business and sales teams.

    <header>Fintech Internship</header>
    <context>
        Internship experience in backend development, data 
        engineering, API design, and mathematical computation, 
        using PostgreSQL, Java, and Postman.
    </context>
    <document>
        I worked as a Back-end Development Intern at Fintech 
        Transformative Technology in Nairobi, Kenya, from July 
        2022 to August 2022.  
        ---
        I contributed to the implementation of PostgreSQL query 
        pipelines across multiple tables, extracting key insights 
        to support the operation of multi-regional commercial 
        banking applications.  
        ---
        I evaluated trade-offs between REST and SOAP API 
        paradigms while designing the distributed system 
        architecture for backend services, using Postman for API 
        testing and validation.  
        ---
        I developed a custom Complex Number Class in Java using 
        Euler forms to support advanced mathematical 
        computations, enabling the creation of further analytical 
        tools.
