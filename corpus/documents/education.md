        I completed my Master’s degree at Imperial College 
        London between August 2024 and August 2025, earning an 
        MSc in Business Analytics. I was awarded the Africa 
        Regional Scholarship in recognition of my academic 
        potential and achievements.  
        ---
        The course covered areas such as machine learning, data 
        visualisation, and statistical modelling. It emphasised 
        practical applications of data science techniques in 
        industries including finance, retail, digital marketing, 
        social media, energy, and supply chain. This programme 
        strengthened my ability to work with complex datasets 
        and extract actionable insights, particularly in 
        quantitative research and applied machine learning.  
        ---
        The modules I completed included: Data Structures and 
        Algorithms, Maths and Statistics for Analysis, Database 
        Technologies, Statistics and Econometrics, Optimisation 
        and Decision Models, Network Analytics, Machine Learning, 
        Advanced Machine Learning, Financial Analytics, Data 
        Wrangling and Visualisation, Text Analysis for Business, 
        Digital Marketing Analytics, Data Management and Ethics, 
        and Generative AI and Large Language Models.

        I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Systems 
        Engineering at the University of Warwick between 
        September 2021 and July 2024, graduating with Upper 
        Second-Class Honours. The degree combined computer 
        science and electronic engineering, with a focus on 
        designing computer systems and integrating hardware 
        with software. This gave me the ability to work on 
        complex engineering projects requiring expertise in 
        both domains, and positioned me with a deep, holistic 
        understanding of computer systems.  
        ---
        The modules I completed included: Electrical and 
        Electronic Circuits, Systems Modelling Simulation and 
        Computation, Operating Systems and Computer Networks, 
        Advanced Computer Architecture, Electromechanical 
        System Design, Engineering Mathematics and Data 
        Analysis, Engineering Business Management, Mobile 
        Robotics, High Performance Embedded Systems Design, 
        Neural Computing, and Fundamentals of Modern VLSI 
        Design.
