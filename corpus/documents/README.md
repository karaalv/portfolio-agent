# RAG Agent Corpus Documents ðŸ“ƒ

This folder contains the documents that form the **RAG Agent Corpus**. The knowledge is organized using a **semi-structured** approach, where each file focuses on a specific scope of information; for example, education, projects, or technical skills. Within each file, content is further divided into **subcategories** related to the fileâ€™s main topic.  

To improve retrieval accuracy and relevance, information is stored with **contextual information**, ensuring that each piece of data is easily matched to user queries.  

For easier parsing and automated processing, custom **tags** are embedded within each document. These tags are leveraged during preprocessing to facilitate efficient embedding, indexing, and retrieval.
